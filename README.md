# python_show
showing some example python scripts I made for various reasons

* raw_to_symbol.py is a script that consumes a raw iq sample file produced by a Software Defined Radio; determines the signal, and outputs symboles (encoded bits) along with measurement information about the signal itself.
* basic_help.py is a file required by the script above; I use this like a C/C++ *#include* file --- a library of classes and functions that I used in many other scripts.
